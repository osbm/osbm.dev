## Greetings

Hello everyone! This is my first post on this website. I am planning to share my thoughts and ideas on this blog. Just like how everyone else does.


I wrote my first blog post back in 2017 in Turkish about the Windows registry. I was learning how to add stuff to the right-click menu and found out that I could edit the text on buttons and labels from the registry. I used it to mess with the school computers and almost got in trouble. ðŸ˜…

This may seem like not a big deal but at the time i literally didn't know much english and google translate was NOT as good as today. I discovered these by messing with the Windows registry and trying my best to translate the words in the labels.

So if I wanted to learn something technical, I either needed to find a Turkish resource or try to understand shitty automatic translation. My friend convinced me to write blog posts about the things I learned. So I did. Those two short and weird articles were literally the only output of my efforts to the internet so far at the time. (I didn't even have a GitHub account.)

It felt good for a short time. None of my friends or family were interested of course. But the worst part was i couldn't find my posts interesting or even something worth reading. I was comparing quality of my writing with the stuff i was reading (a.k.a grown adults with many years of experience). Because of this i never wrote another blog to that site.

I don't think this has effected me badly though. i already needed time to study for the university entrance exam.

One day my best-friend and i started a youtube channel named [Bitrogen](https://www.youtube.com/@bitrogen7347). The channel is about algorithm visualizations and explanations.

Looking back on these two adventures specifically I think i always wanted to have a platform which i could share the things i learned with the whole world. I don't know if this is because i am looking for attention or i am just trying to increase available information on the internet.

Recently, i was watching [From Coder to Creator: My Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Opkmr7kAAk) i decided i wanted to perform too.

I like writing. I have been writing my notes and progress in my obsidian vault for a year now. I believe I can make interesting posts here. I have great plans. :)


Now that my rumbling is over i want to go over the tech i use on this website. As you may know I am an AI researcher. i just want set up a static site generator so i can write my blogs in markdown. I want it get as close to obsidian as possible. And i want the host it in github pages so no backend.

Looking at my options. I felt that this would be more easy to do in astro with mdx. I just added latex support for now. But in the future I want to add p5.js and three.js support for on the browser interactive visualizations.

Here are some mic tests below :D

See you on the next one.

This is inline latex: $cos (2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta$

This is standalone latex

$$\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0$$
