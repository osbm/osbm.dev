import P5Sketch from '../../components/P5Sketch.astro';

In 2021, I had a great interest in procedural art and generative coding. I loved watching [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain). So I learned all about [Processing language](https://processing.org/)[^1] and [P5.js](https://p5js.org/). This was super fun and ignited my love for programming again.

[^1]: Nowadays it looks like it has been abandoned in favor of P5.js

I have been drafting a blogpost that i plan to write beautiful plots and even make some of them interactive. So I thought P5.js scripts would be awesome for this considering the fact that i can write components in astro.

Here is the an example blogpost:


```astro

includes_p5js: True
p5_script_path: '../../scripts/hello-world.js'

import P5Sketch from '../../components/P5Sketch.astro';

Text before the canvas.

<P5Sketch sketch_path='scripts/hello-world.js' canvas_id='hello-world' figure_id='1' sketch_description='sketch explanation' />

Text after the canvas.
```

Here you can see the simple P5.js script that creates the canvas:

```js
function setup() {
    let mycanvas = createCanvas(400, 400);
    mycanvas.parent('hello-world');
    background(0);
}
function draw() {
    fill(255);
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}
```

And inside the astro component there is a div html tag with the id of *hello-world* so that the P5.js knows where to put the canvas.

There was an issue I encountered when trying to show more than one sketch and it was only generating one of them. And i found out that to generate more than one sketch in one page i needed to merge all scripts into one file like this.

```js
let canvas1 = function ( p ) {
  p.setup = function() {
    ...
  }
  p.draw = function() {
    ...
  }
};

let canvas2 = function ( p ) {
  p.setup = function() {
    ...
  }
  p.draw = function() {
    ...
  }
}

var mycanvas1 = new p5(canvas1, 'canvas1');
var myp5 = new p5(canvas2, 'canvas2');
```

Now that I resolve my last issue i can show you the last

Here is how it looks:

<P5Sketch sketch_path='scripts/hello-world.js' canvas_id='hello-world' figure_id='1' sketch_description='Very simple P5.js sketch that prints a circle at the position of your cursor' />

I have also been thinking to add a component for [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/). I made a [Sphere Eversion Animation](https://osmanbayram.com/sphere-eversion-animation/) once. And i loved it a lot. But i thought that this would be a little overkill.

See you in the next one ❤️❤️❤️
